Or Rock Paper Scissors

This is a sample application for an intro to JavaScript class. We've only covered if/else, while loops and functions so the code follows that.

Code could be shortened and refactored, but it is intended to be read by novice JavaScript programmers.

It was intended to be simple, I hope I succedded.
